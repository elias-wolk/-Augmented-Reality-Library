This project is part of NASA's Hackathon with the theme "Be a Space Geologist." The purpose of this project is to describe and demonstrate an innovative application of an augmented reality library in the field of geological studies. Through this application, geology students and professionals can explore and interact with three-dimensional models of geological formations, minerals, and complex geological structures, providing an engaging and immersive learning experience.

## Features

- Explore three-dimensional models of geological formations, minerals, and complex structures.
- Virtual fieldwork activities such as collecting samples, analyzing rocks and minerals, and simulating geological processes.
- Simulated geological environments based on NASA data.

## Color of Stones

Let's delve into the color of stones and how it's determined by factors such as chemical composition, impurities, crystal structure, treatments, and ambient light. Understanding these factors is crucial for a comprehensive study of geological elements.

### Chemical Composition

The presence of certain minerals or chemical elements in the stone can give it a specific color. For example, iron can result in a reddish or yellowish color, while chromium can produce a green color.

### Impurities

Impurities in the crystal structure can affect the stone's color. Traces of iron or manganese, for instance, can result in different shades in minerals like quartz, found in colors such as white, pink, and amethyst.

### Crystal Structure

The arrangement of atoms in the crystal structure plays a role in the stone's color. Light absorption and reflection by the crystal structure contribute to different colors.

### Treatments and Processing

Some stones may undergo treatments or processing to enhance or alter their color. Gemstones like sapphires and emeralds commonly undergo heat or chemical treatments for color improvement.

### Ambient Light

How the stone interacts with ambient light can also affect its perceived color. Lighting conditions and the light source can make the stone appear different under various circumstances.

## Virtual Environment

With NASA data integrated into this application, students and researchers can engage in virtual fieldwork activities, simulate geological processes, and analyze rocks and minerals in a simulated geological environment.

## Development

Developing a virtual environment involves creating a software system or platform that collects, processes, and presents information related to geology.
